# Backup

A whole heap of backup scripts for various situations.

Currently pre-alpha. Feel free to create pull-requests adding your favourite scripts in the [appropriate folder](https://github.com/ksandom/bu/blob/master/scripts/readme.md).

## Install

For now, the one true way to install it is

    cd ~/placeWhereYouWantToCloneTheRepo
    git clone git@github.com:ksandom/bu.git
    ./install/userLinkedInstall.sh
