# Config

If you get a message saying something like

    blah requireConfig: Could not find config item "numberOfToes". See https://github.com/ksandom/bu/blob/master/config/readme.md

you are probably using an old config file. Usually there should be an example and documentation of how to set it in [general.example.sh](https://github.com/ksandom/bu/blob/master/config/general.example.sh).

As of this writing there is only `general.sh`, however it is envisaged that there will be other config files as requirements grow.
